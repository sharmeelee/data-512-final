# data-512-final
This repository contains all the files for a data exploration project on trending Youtube videos data. The data is analyzed for bias, fairness and any assessment of social dynamics in the online content domain. 
### Motivation and problem statement
The purpose of this data analysis is to understand what makes Youtube videos trend. Is it the content, the uploader or is it a snowball effect of the popularity of the video itself? With online content gaining an increasing share of the human experience, I want to understand what makes content popular. Another rising career for people is being online influencers, many of whom are found on Youtube. What content empowers people to influence other people. Also I would like to understand if negative popularity is as good as positive popularity in the online content world where content is essentially free or paid for by human attention instead of money.
